    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In this project, we will build a 3D position based particle simulator based off the work in  the <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids [Macklin, Muller]</a> paper. This technique combines incompressible flow with vorticity confinement and viscosity to simulate water. Once the mathematical model is implemented, we will use this technique to simulate water. Next, we will move onto other materials such as styrofoam, oil, and boba by implementing Blinn-Phong and specular shading. Finally, We will implement a velocity-based coloring technique that changes the particles' color based on their velocity. Read on to see our implementation approach and results or watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uniKg68YMZw">final video</a>! </p>


    <h2>Technical Approach and Implementation</h2>
    <p>Our approach was largely based off of the Position Based Fluids paper by Macklin and Müller. Before actually updating the particle’s behavior to mimic, we first set up 6 planes for a box and a group of particles to be dropped. We then apply a gravitational force to each particle so that they drop in our simulation. We can divide the implementation into two main parts - incompressibility and vorticity & viscosity. <br><br>
    We first enforce incompressibility by finding the density constraint for each particle found by using the standard SPH density estimator. In our simulations, we set our resting density to have a value around 6000, depending on which material type we were working with.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/1.png" alt="" />  <img src="images/ttech/2.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    In this implementation, we utilize a Poly6 kernel for normal density estimation and a Spiky kernel for gradient calculations. Using these kernels, we find the gradient of the constraint function with respect to a particle k and we account for when k is a neighbor and when k refers to the current particle.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/3.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    We add a relaxation parameter to the density estimator for each particle and gradient of the constraint function together, to then calculate our lambda value. In our simulation, we set our relaxation parameter to be 600. 
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/4.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    To combat over-clustering or clumping we, we add an artificial pressure specified in terms of the smoothing kernel itself. Part of the oil simulation was done by adjusting these parameters and constants. For our simulation, we generally followed the recommended constant values mentioned by Macklin and Müller, except we scaled them down to match our vorticity and viscosity constants.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/5.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    Putting all of this together, we are able to update the current particle’s position for each particle at each timestep.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/6.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    <br><br><br>
    Next, we add vorticity, because position based methods often include additional dampening of particle movement, so in order to counter this we introduce vorticity confinement. This also includes a spiral movement to our particles that helps us better mimic real water. In order to do so, we first calculate the vorticity at a particle’s location using an estimator mentioned by Macklin and Müller, in which we take advantage of the difference in neighboring velocities and utilize the Spiky kernel again.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/7.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    Using the vorticity we calculated, we are then able to create a corrective force in which vector N is described as:
    <center>
      <img src="images/tech/8.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    We had to largely scale down our epsilon constant, or else our simulation would blow up. 
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/9.png" alt="" />
    </center>
    Lastly, we incorporate XSPH viscosity to make ensure that we get coherent motion in our simulations. Like what we did with our vorticity constant, we had to scale down the viscosity constant so that our particles would not overreact.
    <center>
          <img src="images/tech/10.png" alt="" />

    </center>
     
    </p>


    <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
    <p> Over the course of our implementation journey, we encountered a couple of different technical problems. First, we had an issue due to a bug in our plane collision code where our particles were leaking out of the edges and corners of the bounding box. 

    <center>

       <br>
    </center> 

    <p>After adjusting how we calculate plane collisions, we were able to capture and contain all our particles without our bounding volume! Next, due to bugs in our implementation of incompressibility, we ran into a situation where all the particles were exploding away from each other upon collision, resulting in velocities that were too high.</p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p> One of the key lessons we over the course of this project was how to navigate through and parse and academic research paper. Being able to understand the complicated mathematical formulation and translate them into functioning code that models similar results proved to be a really interesting and difficult challenge. Another key learning was around setting up a functioning repository structure, navigating git and cmake configurations, and working with three different people within a single project structure. In the course of the project we also learned a lot about fluid dynamics and particle interactions. Finally, we have a newfound appreciation for the power of the GPU and the incredible speedups possible due to parallelization that made real time graphics and rendering a reality. </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>Below is a demonstration of our results using regular water particles with diffuse and specular Blinn Phong shading: </p>
    <center>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Je64Ns5ZcQs?&autoplay=1&loop=1&playlist=Je64Ns5ZcQs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <figcaption style='font-size: 12px'> Water simulator with Blinn Phong diffuse and specular shading </figcaption>
      <br>
    </center>

    <p>After getting our water simulator to work like we would expect it to, we started experimenting with different shading mechanisms as well as different material properties. Our goal was to try to observe how changing different parameters such as particle mass, viscosity and shading parameters can change the overall simulation results. First, we experimented with adding and removing shading from our particles. Without shading, the simulation looks like a singular liquid which we thought was surprisingly realistic. To isolate each particle and visualize how they interact with each other, Blinn Phong shading is definitely more effective:</p>

        <figcaption style='font-size: 12px'> Water simulator with no shading, only diffuse shading and diffuse and specular shading </figcaption>
        <br>
    </center>

    <p>Next, we tried to simulate Styrofoam balls. Styrofoam is really light and should be more bouncy which we were able to achieve by modifying parameters in our particle simulator.</p>

    <center>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HtwxF3UpUQ?&autoplay=1&loop=1&playlist=7HtwxF3UpUQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <figcaption style='font-size: 12px'> Styrofoam particle simulator </figcaption>
      <br>
    </center>

    <p>We also wanted to simulate a liquid with a different viscosity than water. We decided to simulate oil but modifying the viscosity value in the simulator. We also played around with transparency and color parameters of our fragment shaders to achieve the result here:</p>

    <center>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhVtCe572lM?&autoplay=1&loop=1&playlist=jhVtCe572lM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <figcaption style='font-size: 12px'> Oil particle simulator </figcaption>
      <br>
    </center>

    <p>Finally, we wanted to implement velocity based color change in our particles. This should make the simulation more realistic since particles traveling at higher speeds should be lighter (or in the case of water, foamy and white). We decided to create this visualization with a boba simulator. Boba balls are dark but transparent, so our simulator makes the balls increasingly more transparent as the velocity increases. Below is a demo of our favorite boba results:</p>

  	<h2>Abstract</h2>
  	<p>In this project, we will build a 3D position based particle simulator. This project is done based off the work on <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids [Macklin, Muller]</a>. In the current stage of the project, particle-plane collisions and gravitational forces act on the particles allowing them to fall within a confined plane. Up next we will implement rendering of fluid properties including incompressibility (which we are currently debugging), vorticity and viscosity.</p>
  	 

    <h2>Summary of Our Current Progress</h2>
    <p>We began by trying to learn a lot about OpenGl and WebGL. We initially attempted to implement everything using JavaScript, THREE.js and WebGL. We made quite a bit of progress and were able to set up a world, add sphere objects to to our scene, implement falling spheres due to gravity, and account for plane-sphere intersections. Despite all of that, after a conversation with the course staff (Thank you Dillon), we decided to shift gears from that approach and move back to C++ and OpenGL. There are a couple of advantages to shifting our approach:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Javescript is single threaded meaning any speedups would be more difficult to implement</li>
    		<li>There are multiple conflicting and unsupported versions of THREE.js with insufficient frameworks for our purposes</li>
    		<li>Javascript makes us all cry</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <p> Shifting gears to OpenGL, we decided to setup our project structure taking inspiration from Dillon Yao's <a href="https://github.com/yaoius/f2">framework</a>  posted on Piazza. This proved to be a really good starting point since we could save time from setting up the GUI and jump into OpenGL and particle intersection implementation. We followed these steps:

    	<ul>
    		<li>Set up the scene with planes acting as walls to surround the liquid</li>
    		<li>Set up a cube of 1000 particles that fall according to the forces of gravity </li>
    		<li>Implement a spacial map for neighbors</li>
    		<li>Implement equations to account for incompressibility</li>
    	</ul>

	We currently have some bugs in our incompressibility code that we are going to dive into after the midterm (TT__TT), so we can only really visualize the forces of gravity acting on the spheres. Here is a quick visualization:</p>

    <h2>Timeline Update</h2>
    <p>We believe we are on track to accomplish our goals for this project. Taking time to get antiquated with openGL and feel comfortable the the language in the paper took us longer than we anticipated. However, despite the fact that we've encountered difficulties and bugs, we were able to create an initial structure and think we will be able to accomplish all our goals by the final deadline.</p>

  		<h2>Final Project Proposal: 3D Fluid Interactions with Different Viscosities</h2>

    <center>
      <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
    </center>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Our project is a 3D fluid simulator in a confined space. It will simulate the interaction between fluids of different viscosities and physical properties. </p>


    <h2>Problem Description</h2>

    <p>We want to simulate the interaction of fluids of different properties with each other. This includes, how particles will interact with themselves and how particles will interact with different types of particles, which means we will have to account for different types of collisions not only between different particles but also between particles and the environment (e.g. the container).
	</p>

	<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>

	<p><strong>Baseline goals</strong><br> Our objective is to simulate 3D models of water in containers of various sizes - including different objects. Afterwards we will use this simulation to expand on liquids of different viscosities - oils and metallic particles.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Baseline deliverables </strong><br>
		Here is an outline of our objectives:
		<ul>
			<li>We want to simulate the forces for particle to particle collisions of water and fluids of different viscosities. We will have active demos that pour water and <a href="https://www.michael-smith-engineers.co.uk/resources/useful-info/approximate-viscosities-of-common-liquids-by-type">different viscosities</a> oils into a free container, and into containers with other objects in them. </li>
			<li>We will create a demo of oil being poured into water and how it could affect objects within the scene to capture oil-water interactions in a scene.</li>
			<li>We will create a demo of water and and dye interacting with each other to simulate color changes and blending over time. </li>
			<li>We will determine the accuracy of our water simulations and different liquid interactions based off <a href="http://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/fluid_water_3/"> previous known implementations</a>.</li>
			<li>We will test the animation time by timing how long each render takes to reach equilibrium - ie there is no more motion within the liquid. This will be tested by comparing the changes in maximum height for all the water particles. If the height no longer changes within some defined delta then we can conclude that the simulation has reached equilibrium.</li>
		</ul>
		Through these simulation, we will be able to see how certain liquids interact with other liquids and/or with other objects, so that we can simulate real world situations before they occur. <br><br>

		<strong>Aspirational Goals</strong> <br>
		In addition to to goals outlined above, we have some aspirational goals as well which include expanding this system to be interactive so that users can pour their own liquid into the scene, stir the liquid, and move the liquid around using their mouse. <br><br>

		<strong>Aspirational Deliverables</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Create an interactive simulation where we use the mouse to move through the liquid. We will also have keyboard keys to activate a mouse stirrer, or to activate liquids dropping from the mouse.</li>
			<li>Include demonstrations and simulations on how the scenarios would react to change in real-time</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Measuring Quality and Performance</strong> <br>
		We will mainly use qualitative methods to assess the quality and accuracy of our system. We will first get a video/demonstration with real world objects or a verified interactive simulation and take note of the key characteristics of the demonstration/simulation (e.g. the way the particles interact with the wall at what speed/rate of acceleration). We will then observe how many of these characteristics are met by our animation. Lastly, we will take note of the differences between our simulation and the verified simulations online.
	</p>

	<h2>Schedule</h2>
	<p>We are proposing the following schedule for our final project:</p>

	<p><strong>Week 1:</strong><br>
		During the first week we will be working on getting the box meshed set up, creating object meshes and working through particle definitions. <br>
		We will also be working with getting acquainted with all the online resources and reading up on the liquid simulation libraries in C++.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Week 2:</strong><br>
		We will spend the second week working on gravity and normal forces and integrating these physical phenomena with our particles and meshes.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Week 3:</strong><br>
		The third week will be dedicated to collisions. We will work on particle to particle collision and particle to surface collisions.<br> During this week we will only deal with same particles (ie oil with oil and water with water)
	</p>

	<p><strong>Week 4:</strong><br>
		During this week, we will implement particle to particle collisions between different particles in order to simulate interactions of objects with different viscosities. <br>
		We will also implement mouse interactivity with our simulator to include stirring, pouring and dropping particles into the scene (one of our stretch goals).
	</p>
